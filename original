\subsection{Swami Vivekananda}

Chandra and śukra are even, all of the other graha are considered to be odd.

In the chart of Swami Vivekananda the lagna is in the odd sign dhanu, lagneśa
guru is also in an odd sign; So, guru an odd graha is in an odd sign; The rāśi
chart is strong.

Next look at the navāṁśa, take guru as lagna lord from the rāśi chart and see
how it is placed in the navāṁśa. In the navāṁśa guru is in vṛścika, vṛścika is
an even sign, so it is in ugma āṁśa; I call that weak.

Next look at the D60, here I see guru is in an odd sign mithuna, so that I will
say is strong.

So it is that in swami Ji's chart that we find that the rāśi is much stronger
in giving results.

In the tradition we always look at two charts, the rāśi and the navāṁśa; We
will leave the D60 out for now.

If the navāṁśa chart is stronger then we will use it to decide whether or not
any special dāśa is applicable or not.

Here the rāśi chart is stronger so the results from the rāśi predominate in his
life; Not those of the navāṁśa.

So the basic principle here is to decide which chart to use first the, rāśi or
the navāṁśa.

\subsection{Abraham Lincoln}

Let us try another chart, Abraham Lincoln.

N the chart of Abraham Lincoln you will see that the lagna is kumbha, it has
two lords rāhu and śani, rāhu you will see is in libra and śani is in ali. I
take the body planet, rāhu doesn't have a body, so I am starting with the body
planet. Śani has a body and śani is in ali, which is an even sign.

Now the rule was only chandra and śukra are going to be treated as female, the
rest will be treated as male; He has to go out and get, he will not be looked
after; That is the concept. Chandra and śukra are being looked after, the
remaining planets are going out and getting. Śani is in a female sign so I will
say that it is weak.

Let us go to the navāṁśa, in the navāṁśa śani is in tulā; So I can say that the
navāṁśa chart is strong; There is a destiny in this persons life, many things
are by destiny, they are not in his control, he will not decide the path of his
life, much of it will be the unfolding of karma and he really can not say much,
he can not do much.; But he will have very strong thoughts, and those strong
thoughts will all come from the navāṁśa.

For example; You will observe that there is a maṅgal śukra combination in the
lagna, here I will say that śukra is the seventh lord from the navāṁśa lagna in
lagna, so a special dāśa should apply, which is called the dwisaptati sama
dāśa.

Like that the whole idea is to understand the rāśi and the navāṁśa and decide
which of the two is the more predominant in his life. Once we are clear about
that then other things will become much easier. So often we have to first study
the navāṁśa chart in the horā scope of Abraham Lincoln, then I will say, maṅgal
and śukra are in vṛścika lagna, maṅgal shows a fighter, śukra shows a person
who studies very thoroughly, has focus, Guru is in the ninth house, he is very
trust worthy, a very faithful person, a very honest man. Rāhu and chandra are
in the fourth house; He may be betrayed by people he trusts. The tenth lord
sūrya is in the twelfth house in maraṇa kāraka sthāna; So when he will have
power, when he will come to position, sūrya will indicate maraṇa kāraka, or in
other words. He will be fighting battles, he will be struggling, it will not be
an easy job when he is the president.

Right, these things are very easy; lagna lord in the tenth house in the
navāṁśa, lagna lord in the tenth house in the rāśi, so that is a similar,
siddhi yoga is similar in both rāśi and navāṁśa.

Did you see what I was doing; I was studying the navāṁśa like an independent
horāscope. I am not just studying the rāśi chart like an independent horāscope;
I am studying the navāṁśa as if this is the horāscope.

\subsection{Return to swami ji}

You see now if we look at swami Vivekananda's chart, you will find sūrya over
here and the lagna lord going to the eleventh house in the rāśi, where as in
the navāṁśa it has gone to the seventh house with śani. Which is showing a
wondering monk; Somebody who is going around all over the place, you will see
that the lagna lord is in a chara rāśi over here in the rāśi chart, it is
showing somebody who is going every where; he was going to London and going to
America, in those days, for a monk with no money who has to travel all over the
world, this is absurd. Where as in the navāṁśa chart it is saying that lagna
lord maṅgal is in a fixed sign; So he is in one place. Which is the truth; The
truth is that he traveled all over the place, so the rāśi chart is much
stronger than the navāṁśa chart, it is giving the results of the life of the
native.

So, so far we have got a very decent idea of what is happening.

You can see that the version of the śrī Jyoti star that I am using is the
version seven, it is not the version that many of you have, so it is possible
that I can show a couple of charts which you might not have; So don't blame me
if you don't want, get in touch with Andrew.

\subsection{Guru Ji's chart}

Ok now in this chart, this is my chart. I always used to have a lot of fun with
mu students; I would tell them that I am running vimśottari dāśa, and then I
would tell them why that dāśa is not applying, and every body is trying to make
predictions and even the simple things don't work. I will show you, let us try
vimśottari dāśa in this chart. Just one incident, I know all of you are going
to laugh, I am going to talk about a dog bite.

Many many years back when I started teaching Jyotiṣa, I told every body; I
suffered from a very severe and dangerous dog bite, I had become completely
unconscious, for about five or six hours and when I regained conciousness it
was evening or maybe late at night. So this is an incident which happened in
1969 in February; So shall we see the vimśottari dāśa; You will see that the
incident happened in guru dāśa budha antardāśa, so if you seethe vimśottari
dāśa and you look at the rāśi chart, you will say, guru is alone as th lord of
lagna in lagna, budha is in the sixth house; How can this happen in guru dāśa,
budha antardāśa. My question is and later on you may explain, budha is subject
to pāpakartarī yoga, and budha and chandra are aspecting each other, which is
causing tension in the horāscope; I don't understand how it causes tension,
budha is the lord of the fourth chandra is the lord of the fifth; It is a very
powerful rājayoga for learning; The person will learn and have a lot of
knowledge, and this yoga is causing tension yoga, I don't know how. The seventh
lord and fifth lord is also chandra and budha yoga; So why would budha cause
something like a dog bite. Budha is vargottama in the horāscope, it does not
work that way. So you see that vimśottari dāśa is not working; We could try
other varieties, but let us go back to the rāśi and the navāṁśa.

Now in the rāśi chart what is the lagna lord; The first lagna lord is guru, but
there is a second lagna lord and that is ketu, because ketu is mūlatrikoṇa in
mīna; You see that every planet has a home and it has an office. The home of
the planet shows the personal life of the native, the office of the planet
shows the professional life of the native, what we call the inside life and the
out side life. So we are looking at guru because he is the lord of the lagna
and here the body planet. Guru is odd, so guru should be in an odd sign, in the
rāśi chart guru is in mīna, and in the navāṁśa chart guru is in kumbha, so you
see the same guru in the navāṁśa is in an odd sign where as in the rāśi it is
in an even sign; So guru says that the results of the navāṁśa will be stronger.
That is what guru the lagna lord says, he says no, I will not allow you to
create more karma, you have to experience the karma of the last life and that
experience of last life karma is very important for you. So As the dominances
he says that the navāṁśa chart will dominate over the rāśi chart. So if the
navāṁśa chart is going to dominate over my rāśi chart; Let me look at my
navāṁśa chart. My navāṁśa chart says that lagna lord maṅgal is in the seventh
house and the seventh lord śukra is in lagna, lagna lord in seventh, seventh
lord in lagna. Wow, that is completely different, that is bringing into the
picture a dāśa system called the dwisaptati sama, so now when I click on
dwisaptati sama and now I see what was the dāśa and antardāśa that I was
running when I had the dog bite; February 1969 was śani dāśa maṅgal antardāśa;
You see that, śani dāśa maṅgal antardāśa. Do you think that śani and maṅgal can
give me something like a terrible dog bite; A death like experience. You see
this maṅgal is in maraṇa kāraka sthāna in the rāśi chart and the navāṁśa chart,
śani is the ātmakāraka, śani and maṅgal are in trines to each other, so it is
possible that in śani dāśa maṅgal antardāśa, the person will have a horrible
experience, a death like experience.

OK, somebody will say, no no no no, vimśottari dāśa we can still use and we can
explain budha from the rāśi chart; Ok let us say that you did that. Try this,
at the age of about one year of age; I was a baby, and I slipped and fell
inside the Hirakud dam, the chances of survival were next to nothing, you know
how big these dams are, and my Granny saw me slipping and she dived into the
water, she swam and pulled me out. Now If I use vimśottari dāśa, I am running
guru dāśa, guru antardāśa; Do you think that in guru dāśa guru antardāśa that
this person can fall inside of a Hirakud dam and have a near to death
experience; Do you think that you can make a prediction with that? No, you can
not, you can not make a prediction. Even if I am given such a horāscope, I cant
make a prediction like that, on the other hand, if I use the dwisaptati sama I
find that, oh, it is śani dāśa, śani antardāśa; You see that, śani dāśa, śani
antardāśa. Śani is ātmakāraka, it is retrograde, He is saying, go back, why
have you come. He is aspected by rāhu in the navāṁśa, rāhu is conjoining
maṅgal. Śani dāśa, śani antardāśa is perfect for a death like experience, that
to in water, why water? Śani is in makara, slippery ground, I slipped, śani is
the dispositor of chandra which is in the third from ārūḍha lagna, you can see
the ārūḍha lagna over here and you can see that the danger of death and water
was there.

Ok, so now we are sort of clear that it is not easy to use just one dāśa and we
have to understand that the dāśa that we are going to use will depend upon
whether the rāśi chart is stronger or the navāṁśa chart is stronger. The
primary dāśa has to be chose n on that basis. The method for choosing the
strongest between the rāśi chart and the navāṁśa is ... Ok I will quickly go
through it again.

% [//]: # ( remark - todo - which chart do we see this in? )

For example, if you see the dwisaptati sama dāśa it was in śani dāśa, śani
antardāśa that I actually fell inside the dam and my grandmother rescued me;
Granny rescued me, keep that in mind. Grandmother is seen from which house,
mothers mother; He seventh house right. But will I be seeing that in the rāśi
chart? Ok we will go into details later, you have done divisional charts. So
now you can clearly see that the person was rescued, because guru is in lagna.
Because guru is in lagna, he got rescued. On the other hand if I use the
vimśottari dāśa, you will see that actually the event happened in guru dāśa,
guru antardāśa; So two major incidents, pleas make a note; Look at my horāscope
and try to explain these two incidents. Number one near death by drowning, by
falling into a dam, it happened at around nine months to ten months of age; or
may be one year. I was crawling, so it must be eight or nine months; Just
learning to walk. The second incident; A dog bite, five years, six months and
seven days, roughly February 1969. So these are the two important incidents and
you can not explain these two incidents using the vimśottari dāśa.  You can not
do it. When you try to do it it will flop upon your face. On the other hand if
you use the traditional method by we determine whether the rāśi is stronger or
the navāṁśa is stronger; You will see guru which is the lord of lagna is in an
even sign in the rāśi chart and an odd sign in the navāṁśa; So the navāṁśa
chart is stronger than the rāśi chart. So the navāṁśa chart says, ali is the
lagna, lagna lord maṅgal is in a fixed sign, which means that basically this
guy doesn't like to move around; He likes to sit in one place. He can sit in
one place from the morning until the evening, which is true about me, I don't
need to be moving about, I sit and study, I can sit for hours. And there is a
parivarthana between maṅgal and śukra with lagna lord in the seventh and
seventh lord in lagna and so because of that we are not going to use
vimśottari, we will use  dwisaptati sama. You see we will do more of these dāśa
when we go into year three. As we go into year three, we will be studying more.
But if I don't have the basis of year 2b, what dāśa I will do in year three.
You see my point, we need to have a very clear understanding whether the rāśi
chart is more dominant or the navāṁśa chart is more dominant; What happens if
neither of them are; Let us take a case.

\subsection{Rafal, female in both rāśi and navāṁśa}

Do any of your charts say, anybody, now please use your chart and tell me which
is stronger, does anybody have lagna lord yugma and the lagna lord is odd; In
the rāśi in a female sign and in the navāṁśa also in a female sign; Do you have
that? Anybody, ok Rafal says that he has got it; Rafal can you send me your
birth details, maybe I have your birth details, let me open up your data, no it
has gone. Let me just open a new database. Yes here I have Rafal your chart; so
now I will be sharing your screen. This is very important, you must understand
that this is extremely important.

Now we have the chart of Rafal, he was born on the 25th of October 1982 at
7:35pm in a place called Gleiwiez in Poland, so for those of you who want to
make a chart quickly, make a chart with the name Rafal. Look at Rafal chart;
It is mithuna lagna, that means that there is only one planet which is the lord
of lagna, there is no confusion, lagna lord budha is in exhaltation, wow, but
it is in an even sign, it is in kanyā, so budha is, remember only chandra and
śukra are to be treated as female, all other planets are to be treated as
male. Budha is in an even sign; Not accepted in the rāśi chart, in the navāṁśa
chart budha is again in an even sign, this is, this is wrong. In the rāśi chart
it is not happening, in the navāṁśa chart it is not happening; That means that
there is another chart that we have to see, I am now going to use the D60
chart, you see the bottom row now you will see the D60 chart; In the D60 also
budha is in an even sign, you see the problem here; In the rāśi chart budha is
in an even sign, in the navāṁśa chart budha is in an even sign and is th D60
chart also budha is in an even sign. So I will say, this lagna is very weak;
May be this person will get all of the results of his life from the seventh
house. So instead of lagna, I will try the seventh house; OK. Did you see what
I did. In the rāśi in the navāṁśa and in the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa, lagna lord budha is in
even signs, so then I take the seventh house, the seventh house is dhanu, the
lord of that sign is guru and guru is a male planet, it is placed in a male
sign, that is tulā, this is very fine, in the navāṁśa also it is in a male
sign, very fine, in the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa also it is in a male sign. So if I have to
start, I always start with the rāśi, if it does not satisfy then I will go to
the navāṁśa, is the navāṁśa satisfies then I will not go the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa; So
like that. In the rāśi chart, guru as the lord of the seventh house, is in an
odd sign, so I will say fine. I will have to use the rāśi chart. That is how we
do oja yugma bāla, we decide, what decides; In his case it is guru which is
chart choice as the rāśi chart; Keep that in mind. It is also possible that
such a person will get all of the results of his life; Not from the lagna, but
from the seventh house. Jaimini has mush more on this we will go into it later
when we learn Jaimini; For now keep this in mind, how to find which is
stronger.

So Rafal did you get that? Good. So it is explained. Nitin, I believe that you
also have a case where your lagna lord guru is in an even sign in the rāśi in
mīna and it is in kanyā in the navāṁśa; So now you know how to really look and
find out, how will I do it, I will have to start with the rāśi, then go to the
navāṁśa, then to the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa; There is a very deep meaning behind what I
am teaching you; this is not something superficial, very deep. If the rāśi
chart is working or is the dominant factor; That means that you have to create
more karmas, that means that you have come here because there is a desire, a
real desire is causing rebirth; If it is the navāṁśa chart then there are some
karmas of the last life; Some karmas, which you will face, after the karma is
finished, then the rāśi chart will take over; If instead it is the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa
chart, the this life is only a continuation of the last life, this life can not
really be treated as separate from the last life; This is very serious.

Which vargottama are you talking about Rafal? No no, it is only one planet,
nothing else matters, only one planet, there is no other planet. IN your case
the planet is budha, right, your lagna is mithuna and your lagna lord is budha;
There is no other planet in the horāscope, only one planet I am taking. Do you
see the point here, I am taking budha to see whether it is in an odd sign in
the rāśi, whether it is in odd sign in the navāṁśa; Then if it is in an odd
sign is ṣaṣṭyāṁśa. If budha was in an even sign in the ṛṣi, then I don't have
to see further, I will stop over there and then I will use the rāśi chart. If
it is in an even sign in the rāśi, then I check the navāṁśa, if again in the
navāṁśa it is in even sign, then I will check ṣaṣṭyāṁśa. So if rāśi navāṁśa
ṣaṣṭyāṁśa; If all three are in even signs, then I will take the seventh house.
Like that I have to go, it is a very important step, you see the importance of
kendra, and also you see the order that I am doing, I am starting with the
lagna, I am checking the rāśi navāṁśa and the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa; If all three are
failing, then I go to the seventh house, and then I again see rāśi navāṁśa and
ṣaṣṭyāṁśa. This is a very important system because in Jaimini later you will
learn much more advanced concepts, you will see that there are many issues
coming up.

Visti has a question, "What is the seventh lord is not strong?", Give me a
case, can you check up a chart and tell me that the seventh lord is not strong?

The order is very important, the order is very critical; You can not go to the
ṣaṣṭyāṁśa chart straight away, you have to go to the rāśi chart, then you have
to go to the navāṁśa chart and then you go to the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa chart; You don't go
to the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa chart straight away.

So this was the point of my little chat with you today, I want you all to go
back and study charts, and <hat I will be doing is I will be mailing a link to
you, you then can post some cases in which you nave difficulty in
understanding, I want you to study very carefully the rāśi navāṁśa ṣaṣṭyāṁśa,
three charts. Remember, ṣaṣṭyāṁśa is past life, rāśi is present life and the
navāṁśa is middle, the middle case, the passing of past life karmas to the ...
I can say that the rāśi chart is bhūloka, I can say that the navāṁśa chart is
bhuva loka, I can say that ṣaṣṭyāṁśa chart is svarga loka, heaven. So like that
what happens is, I can not go to the D60 chart unless I have said that the rāśi
chart is not having ojabala, it must have oja yogma bāla, if it doesn't then
check up the navāṁśa chart, the navāṁśa should have oja yugma bāla; If not then 
check the ṣaṣṭyāṁśa.

\subsection{Visti}

Let us take Visti's case, Visits case I know, Andrew has a very important
question and Rafal has a very important question; What happens when there is
parivarthana? For that fine, let us take Visti's example. Remember what I have
told you, you will only take the lagna lord, there is no other planet, no other
planet is existing. Here in Visti's chart it is ali lagna, the lagna lord
maṅgal is in the tenth house, and the tenth lord sūrya is in lagna, can you see
the parivarthana yoga of lagna in the tenth house, there is parivarthana yoga
but we can not consider that, it is not allowed, because we are not considering
the sun at all, we don't care about the sun; We are only considering the lagna
lord, because the lagna lord is the parka lagna, and the parka lagna is very
important; Did you understand what I am talking about, I am talking about
something called the parka lagna, so I see that in his chart he has got two
lagna lords, one is maṅgal and the other is ketu. Maṅgal is in an odd sign and
ketu is in an even sign; I can also say that maṅgal is stronger than ketu in
this chart; You see my point, from this, why because maṅgal is forcing us to
decide that the ṛṣi chart is stronger, because in the navāṁśa chart, Visti has
got maṅgal in ali navāṁśa. You can clearly see that t he rāśi chart is the
strong chart, there is no need for me to go to any other chart, in the rāśi
chart, what ever the rāśi chart will say I will use that dāśa; In his case for
example I will use vimśottari dāśa and after choosing the vimśottari dāśa I
will go to the options and you can see under the dāśa options I will have to
chose the dāśa starting point starting; here I have an option of choosing
Utpana so I will chose that and then according to this dāśa I see that these
are his dāśa. He was born in guru dāśa, śukra antardāśa and so on you can see
the dāśa that he has passed through ,śani dāśa finished somewhere in the year
2004 and after that the budha das a started. Budha is the eighth lord in the
twelfth house which is showing Kṛṣṇa bhakti and therefor from the budha dāśa he
has been following Kṛṣṇa bhakti. Ok all of the other things you can see,; His
marriage and many other details. So do you see my point, Visti is it very clear
for you now, Andrew is it very clear, that we can not take another, because
only the lagneśa, parka lagna the brain the head, don't forget, for human
beings this is important, this is very important for human beings. Here you can
seethe importance of the human brain, because the human brain is holding the
gāyatrī mantra and that is why the human brain is very important. Ok good,
and with this I shall end my small Webinar.E
